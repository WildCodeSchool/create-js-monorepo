## Concept

This template is meant to serve as a foundation for every P2/P3 following the React-Express-MySQL stack, as learned in Wild Code School.
It's pre-configured with a set of tools which'll help students produce industry-quality and easier-to-maintain code, while staying a pedagogical tool.

## Setup & Use

### Windows users

Be sure to run these commands in a git terminal to avoid [issues with newline formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Issues_with_different_newline_formats):

```
git config --global core.eol lf
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- If you are using `yarn` or `pnpm`, adapt the `config/cli` in `package.json`
- Run command `npm install` (or equivalent using `yarn` or `pnpm`)
- Create environment files (`.env`) in both `backend` and `frontend`: you can copy `.env.sample` files as starters (**don't** delete them)

### Before you start

- To ensure compatibility and prevent conflicts, please consistently employ a **single** package manager: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

### Available Commands

- `db:migrate` : Run the database migration script
- `db:seed` : Run the database seed script
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server
- `lint` : Runs validation tools (will be executed on every _commit_, and refuse unclean code)

## FAQ

### Tools

- _Concurrently_ : Allows for several commands to run concurrently in the same CLI
- _Husky_ : Allows to execute specific commands that trigger on _git_ events
- _Vite_ : Alternative to _Create-React-App_, packaging less tools for a more fluid experience
- _ESLint_ : "Quality of code" tool, ensures chosen rules will be enforced
- _Prettier_ : "Quality of code" tool as well, focuses on the styleguide
- _ Airbnb Standard_ : One of the most known "standards", even though it's not officially linked to ES/JS

### Deployment with Traefik

> ⚠️ Prerequisites : You must have installed and configured Traefik on your VPS beforehand.
> https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/vps-traefik-starter-kit/

For deployment, you have to go to `secrets` → app `actions` on the github repo to insert via `New repository secret` :

- SSH_HOST : IP address of your VPS
- SSH_USER : SSH login to your VPS
- SSH_PASSWORD : SSH connection password to your VPS

And a public variable from the tab `/settings/variables/actions`

- PROJECT_NAME : the name of the project used to create the subdomain for frontend.

The backend subdomain will be automatically created with the suffix -backend.
The global variable VITE_BACKEND_URL will be automatically created and pre-filled on the basis of this information.

Use this same tab to add the other environment variables required for the project if any.
